			<h3>Solar panels</h3>
			<p>
				Solar panels are a way of generating energy without using fosil resources. Also generating energy 
				this way prevents the greenhouse effect which is being activated by Co2 release from changing fosil resources
				into usable energy. The solar panels convert sunlight into DC energy, which then is changed to AC energy,
				which is ready to be used. Solar panels will even work when its clouded, the sun will travel trough the clouds 
				and the panels will convert energy from the light beams.

			<h3>Charge controller</h3>	
			<p>
				A charge controller makes the harvest of energy more sufficient, it maximises the harvest. 
				The charge controller drives the energy harvest intelligently to achieve full charge in the 
				shortest amount of time. A controller can also charge an extremely depleted battery. If the 
				cells are not damaged or permanently sulphated, it can operate with a battery voltage 
				as low as 0 volts. The controller makes sure that all the power from the panels is being stored, the  
				advantage is really noticeable when the sky is clouded.

			<h3>Battery system</h3>
			<p>
				A battery system saves the surplus energy. The surplus energy is the energy left after all devices 
				in a house are provided with enough energy to run. Systems like a fridge, freezer, toaster, coffee maker etc... after 
				these devices have had enough power the battery saves all the remaining energy made from the solar panels. 
				The battery makes sure you have solar energy available at any time when you need it.

		<article id="article__4" class="howsolarworks__article">
			<h3>DC power</h3>
			<p>
				Direct current (DC) just like AC is an electrical charge. Direct current is undirectional or one directional flow. Direct current can flow 
				through a wire(conductor), semiconductors, insulators or a vacuum(electron or ion beams). The electric current 
				from direct current flows in the same direction, which is the difference between alternating current (AC).
				The solar panels transform the sun beams into direct current when recieving the energy. The direct current is not the final 
				form of energy used by the consumer.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="article__5" class="howsolarworks__article">
			<h3>Inverter</h3>
			<p>
				A power inverter or short inverter is an electronic device that converts direct current (DC) into 
				alternating current (AC). The output voltage and frequency, overall power handling and input voltage 
				depend on how the specific device is designed and how the circuitry is build. Do not mistake the inverter 
				for a power source, it only converts the power it recieves from a direct current source into alternating current
				energy, which is then usable for devices that run on alternating current.
			</p>
		</article>
		<article id="article__6" class="howsolarworks__article">
			<h3>AC power</h3>
			<p>
				The electric current alternating current (AC) can periodically reverse direction and changes 
				its size with time constantly with time, which is different to direct current (DC), direct current 
				only flows in one way. Alternating current, is the energy source used by recidences and businesses. This 
				form of energy powers devices such as fridges, freezers, coffee makers etc... The short notations for 
				alternating current and direct current is AC and DC. Using the short notation makes it easy to understand 
				which current is being used.
